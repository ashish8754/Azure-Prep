Azure Cloud Fundamentals
		
	
	Features of cloud computing	:
		-High Availability :- Capability of having several VMs which can kick in to speed up the process requests
		-Fault tolerance :- How azure will make sure that we get zero downtime for the services provided by azure
		-Disaster Recovery :- In case of natural disasters how azure will make sure that the all the data and services are recovered using time-to-recovery and recovery point metrics.
		-Scalability :- Scaling up or down based on reuqirement.
		-Elasticity :-ability to quickly increase or decrease the processing power and resources .
		-Agility :- ability to rapidly develop, test and deploy applications
		
	Capital Expenditure(CAPEX): cost occured to the organisation for getting fixed asset resources like land , buildings etc.
	Operational Expenditure(OPEX): running cost occured to company for running a service , business or system on a daily basis Ex-Electricity bill, hosting charges ,printer costs ,etc.
	
	Azure follows Consumption based pricing model :
		-Pay per execution - Pay only for the no of times the request is sent to the servers
		-pay per second - pay for the resources for the time period used
		-Usually a combination of the 2 are taken by the companies
		-This pricing model is one of the major reasons for companies to switch to cloud as it reduces their CAPEX and OPEX significantly.
		
	Cloud Service Models:
		-Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
			-Here infra like servers and VMs are provided by the cloud provider
			-no need to buy hardware 
			-Scaling is much faster
		
		-Platform as a Service(PaaS)
			-Superset of IaaS with middleware softwares and other relevant tools
			-Supports the complete Web Development Cycle
			-For a consumer it removes the hassle of maintaining all the softwares needed, they only need to focus on the work and all the rest will be handled by Azure.
			
		-Software as a Service(SaaS)
			-Providing complex softwares as a service
			-user only need to pay access fee 
			-no maintaining required and also always have access to latest features.
			-Ex- Office 365 ,Outlook,etc.
			
		Serverless
			-Means youy dont have your own servers instead your applications are being deployed on some other servers
			-this allows a single function to be hosted , deployed , run and managed on its own.
			
			
	
	Cloud Architecture models
		
		Private
			-Personal cloud only accessible to the relevant people allowed
			Pros
				-Better Security and privacy
				-Complete contrtol of the infrastructure
				-Features of a public cloud
			Cons
				-Maintainance has to be done by the customer which again becomes similar to owning their own data centres.
				
		Public Cloud
			- Azure, AWS ,GCP- basically cloud provided by cloud providers
			Pros
				-no need to buy infra since its being provide by the cloud provider
				-low maintainnace fees
			Cons
				-No control over the features and versions
				-no physical access
				
		Hybrid Cloud
			-Combination of public and private
			-Avoid disruptions and outages
			-Adhere to regulations, governance ,etc
			-Have access to both private and public cloud base on the design
			-Only downside is that the architecture is very complex to design, but if done properly hybrid is the best model
